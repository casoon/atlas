- ‚úÖ `.npmignore` created to control published content
- ‚úÖ Changesets configured for coordinated releases

### CI/CD Setup
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflows created:
  - `ci.yml` - Build and type checking on PRs

## üîÑ Next Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Push to the public repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/casoon/atlas.git
git branch -M master
git push -u origin master
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Repository Settings
- [ ] Set repository description: "CASOON Atlas - A comprehensive, modern UI effects library built for Tailwind v4"
- [ ] Add topics: `tailwind`, `css`, `javascript`, `effects`, `ui`, `components`, `ssr`, `typescript`
- [ ] Enable Issues and Discussions

### 3. Setup NPM Publishing
```bash
# Login to npm (one-time setup)
npm login

# Or set NPM_TOKEN in GitHub Secrets for automated publishing
# Get token from: https://www.npmjs.com/settings/tokens
```

### 4. Configure GitHub Secrets (for automated releases)
Add these secrets in GitHub repository settings:
- `NPM_TOKEN` - Your npm authentication token for publishing packages
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

### 5. First Release
```bash
# Create your first changeset
pnpm changeset

# This will prompt you to:
# - Select which packages to bump
